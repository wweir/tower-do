## 2025-09 — share "changed files" as boundary facts, not diffs (P0 + P1)

**Context.** Research asked whether multiple agents editing one repo should
broadcast their file-change lists to each other. Naive answers (post every diff
/ file list to the board) fail: a diff is a *flow*, the board is a *converging
snapshot* (model mismatch); unconditional sharing burns context and is noise;
and broadcasting changes who *sees*, not who *tells the truth* — trust needs
tool-read git, not more copies.

**Decision.** Share **subtracted signals**, not the raw list:

1. **P0 — `changedFiles` delivery receipt.** A completed task may carry the
   files its owner actually changed (a worker sets it once when completing;
   the owner / `tower` may amend — worker edits to another's receipt are
   rejected by the every-field owner guard). It is *audit trail*, explicitly
   *not* an authority — never a merge gate.
   Rationale: closes the handoff information gap (a dependent task knows what
   its upstream touched) and the trust gap (scope used to be only a *plan*;
   the receipt is the closest thing to a *fact* the board can hold without
   git access).
2. **P1 — derived scope-conflict advisory.** `tower_do_status` derives
   *overlap* (active task's scope ⊃ a completed task's receipt file) and
   *collision* (two in-progress tasks' scope globs intersect) warnings. Advisory
   only — because scope is a self-declared glob and changedFiles is
   self-reported, neither is authoritative enough to gate on.

**Rejected.** Tool-read `git diff` + scope-containment merge gates (Kimi
Tower's real mechanism). Requires worktree isolation + a merge orchestrator —
a different project. If it ever lands, TowerDo stays the state/communication
backend and the orchestrator consumes the board.

## Prior decisions (condensed from the initial port)

- **File-as-state over locks/daemon.** Board = append-only JSONL; any reader
  sees the same tasks. Communication and state are the same storage primitive.
  (Kimi Tower blackboard lineage; see research/kimi-tower-*.)
- **Revision counts task events only** so messages/findings never stale a peer's
  baseRevision.
- **Full-replacement + every-field owner guard** over per-field merge: with
  full replacement, an unguarded content field would let a stale replay roll
  back a peer's concurrent update.
- **`tower` reserved identity** as the orchestrator escape hatch (owner of
  everything). It is not claimable via config, so no session can *drift into*
  the orchestrator role by default; an explicit `as: "tower"` call remains the
  documented (unauthenticated, cooperative-trust) way for the orchestrator to
  act. Same class of collision: the broadcast keyword `"all"` is rejected as
  any identity (config / `as` / owner).
- **Config surface is `identity` only** (config.json, optional, safe to
  commit). Reminder cadence, widget rows, activity tail, and message retention
  are internal constants — no user evidence ever justified tuning them, and
  every knob is permanent schema+docs+test surface. A malformed config fails
  loudly instead of silently defaulting: a silently-reset identity corrupts
  owner matching in multi-agent sessions.
- **Message read receipts (`readBy`) + audience snapshots** so broadcast
  retirement is bounded and late joiners don't pin history forever.
- **Advisory scope today.** `scope` is a declared mission boundary with owner
  gate + schema validation, but no file-level enforcement — enforcement is
  explicitly out of scope until an orchestrator with worktrees exists.
